In this I have migrated existing backend from dockerized app to serverless app using AWS Lambda and API Gateway and dynamo db instead of pgsql and traditional backend thing and I have used a trick, So basically what happens is that we get 1million lamdas and 2 million google functions so I have deployed lambda functions as well as google cloud functions and we dont have a state so in frontend i am using a probability function which will use lambda api 1/3 times and gcp api 2/3 times okay good night.
